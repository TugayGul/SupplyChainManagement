# SupplyChainManagement

I couldn't finish it. I didn't merge my dev and test branches to main because I am not sure. I'll continue this project when I have free time.
Thanks to IntelliJ I ended up in a spot SQL queries and Hibernate as ORM included in same project. However, I created rest endpoints properly. 
I had difficulties with authentication. I didn't have enough time to set a correct implementation. Still, I count this as a nice experience since I practiced JSP and java. 
Thanks for the opportunity.
